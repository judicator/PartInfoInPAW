# Part info in PAW menu

Very small and simple mod for Kerbal Space Program.
Mod works in VAB/SPH and adds some useful information about part to right-click menu (PAW menu):
* part name (basically, part ID);
* dry mass;
* cost;
* entry cost.

By default, mod only applies itself to engines, but can be added to any parts.
For engines, more information is displayed:
* dry engine TWR (thrust / engine mass);
* formatted string of additional data about engine (the same you can see in part information screen in left panel in VAB/SPH). If part has more than one ModuleEngines (for example, multi-mode engine like RAPIER), information for first two ModuleEngines will be displayed.

Actually, one picture can tell more than a thousand words:
